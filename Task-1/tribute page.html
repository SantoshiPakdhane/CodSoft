                About the Heroic, Exemplary, Outstanding and Inspiring Legend
            </h1>
            <p>
                ☛ <b>Introduction: </b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was a great ideal king of India. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's full name was Shivaji Bhosale. He was a very intelligent and brave ruler. He laid the foundation of the Maratha Empire in western India. Shivaji Maharaj was a supporter of Marathi and Sanskrit languages..<br><br>
                ☛ <b>Place of Birth and Parents: </b>Shivaji Maharaj was born on 19th February 1630 in Shivneri Fort, Maharashtra. His father's name was Shahaji Bhonsle and mother's name was Jijabai Jadhav.<br><br>
                ☛ <b>Upbringing and Education: </b>His parents had a great influence on the character of Shivaji Maharaj. His entire childhood was spent under the guidance of his mother. His mother used to tell him stories from Ramayana and Mahabharata so that the character of Shivaji could be formed. Shivaji Maharaj started taking education of weapons as well as religious texts in his childhood.<br><br>
                ☛ <b>Married life: </b>Shivaji Maharaj was married to Saibai Bhonsale on 14th May 1640 at Lal Mahal, Pune. He had done 8 marriages in his life. Shivaji Maharaj had a total of 2 sons and 6 daughters.
                <br><br> ☛ <b>Coronation: </b>The coronation of Shivaji Maharaj took place at Raigad in 1674. He became "Chhatrapati" as soon as he was coronated. 
                <br><br> ☛ <b>Skills: </b>Shivaji was a brave man. He was also proficient and expert in the art of guerilla fight/warfare. It was he who developed guerrilla fight. Shivaji Maharaj was completely adept at using all kinds of weapons.
                <br><br> ☛ <b>Conflict/Struggle with the Mughals: </b>Shivaji Maharaj spent his entire life fighting with the Mughals. The biggest enemy of Shivaji Maharaj was the Mughals. He wanted to eradicate the Mughals from the country. He defeated the Mughals many times in the war with his strategy.
                <br><br> ☛ <b>War/conflict with Aurangzeb and Afzal Khan: </b>Aurangzeb and Afzal Khan were strong enemies of Shivaji Maharaj. There were many wars between Aurangzeb and Shivaji Maharaj, in which Aurangzeb had to face defeat. Afzal Khan wanted to capture and kill Shivaji. When Shivaji Maharaj met Afzal Khan for the treaty, Afzal Khan attacked Shivaji with a knife. In defense Shivaji Maharaj killed Afzal Khan with his weapon "Waghnakh".
                <br><br> ☛ <b>Died: </b>The great warrior of India Shivaji Maharaj died on 3rd April 1680 in Raigad. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj will always be known in the pages of history as a skilled and brave emperor.
                <br><br> ☛ The humble beginnings of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as he came to be known later are the source of the immense mental strength of the Maratha tiger. Despite having died 300 years ago- on February 19, 1627, Shivaji’s name and presence are continually felt around India, and especially in Maharashtra, thanks to the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus train station. The legacy of the warrior king has only become stronger as the very human warrior king is moulded into the image of the Hindu avenger.
                <br><br> ☛ <b>The absentee father: </b>The Maratha society was "proud-spirited and warlike" as Chinese scholar and pilgrim Xuanzang described, around 1000 years before Shivaji lived. Since much of Maharashtra lies on the rugged terrain of the western Deccan Plateau, life wasn’t exactly easy Since the land was not very rich, the societal rich were not very wealthy either. Those who were poor often joined the armed forces as that gave a good opportunity for people to climb up the social ladder. Shivaji’s father was no different.
                <br><br> ☛ <b>The proud and devoted mother: </b>Jijabai’s devotion to her son and her influence has become the stuff of legends, and with good reason. Sons with absent fathers are almost always extremely influenced by their mother, and this was advanced by the fact that his only brother died when Shivaji was just an adolescent.
                              At the young age itself, he took hold of the small domain around Pune that his distant father assigned to him for administration. But the teenage Shivaji wouldn’t sit content with just that tiny piece of land. He amassed forces and started capturing forts in the surrounding districts.
                <br><br> ☛ <b>The grand tales about of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj: </b>Perhaps the best-known tale about Shivaji is one which is taught to kids in schools around India how he killed Afzal Khan in 1659 at a secret meeting between the two using steel 'tiger claws' and then chopping off his head. Soon, he was in open revolt against the Muslim empire and started positioning himself as the main adversary. The tales of his greatness would help him further establish his image as a great warrior opposing the Muslim rule. Shivaji commissioned a Sanskrit poem on his feats especially for his coronation in 1674. Later arrived a rich collection of Maratha literary sources from the late 17th century ballads to the chronicles known as bakhars.
                <br><br> ☛<b>How he built himself to become the most important rival of the Mughals: </b> Shivaji started to get on the nerves of Aurangzeb before long as he started to snub the Mughals in one incident after another.He humiliated a senior commander of Aurangzeb, and went on to plunder the major commercial port of Mughals and the departure point of their Hajj Surat in 1664. He returned again to fill his treasury again in 1670.
                <br><br> ☛<b>Shivaji's elaborate coronation that established his image as a heroic king: </b> Shivaji's coronation ceremony was majestic and carefully planned to mould his public image so that he would be accepted by the masses. Around 11,000 people climbed up the steep hill to Raigad Fort to attend his coronation in early June 1674 after a 4-month preparation.
                Shivaji’s coronation or 'abhiseka' was a grand affair involving various purification rituals it was carried out by a ruler after around 200 years. The rituals were designed after the orthodox Hindu society Shivaji wanted to rule.

                <h2 id="lifeofshivaji">"Keeping aside the figure of immense Hindu pride,
                     the 'human' Shivaji is courageous, witty, 
                     skilled and incredibly determined.
                      He was a self-made man who started at the bottom 
                      and rose up to become the most important adversary to the 
                      Mughals in the entirety of India before the advent of the British."</h2>
